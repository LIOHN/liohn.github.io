# daniels.knowledge.base

Thanks to GitHub Pages and Jekyll I was able to deploy my new website extremely quickly. Oneadvantages GitHub Pages offers you is the ability to go back in time to earlier versions, as publishing new versions of the website is done within GitHub, a Version Control System. You can publish with git on your own machine, with GitHub Desktop, or on the GitHub Website. This meant I could avoid mistakes and save time compared to the time when I coded my own website from scratch.
While GitHub Pages primarily deals with static websites, I believe they allow for dynamicity. For my purposes however, a static website suffices.

[daniels.knowledge.base](https://liohn.github.io/) will serve as a knowledge base to me and as a project showcase to prospective employers. In it I plan to explain in detail my programming projects since 2016, and also keep notes and potentially share my views of the world in a blog.


### GitHub Pages Installation

To start using Jekyll right away with GitHub Pages, [fork the Millennial repository on GitHub](https://github.com/LeNPaul/Millennial/fork). From there, you can rename your repository to `USERNAME.github.io`, where `USERNAME` is your GitHub username, and edit the `settings.yml` file in the `_data` folder to your liking. Ensure that you have a branch named `gh-pages`. Your website should be ready immediately at 'http://USERNAME.github.io'. Note: if you are hosting several sites under the same GitHub username, then you will have to use [Project Pages instead of User Pages](https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages/) - just change the repository name to something other than 'http://USERNAME.github.io'.

Head over to the `_posts` directory to view all the posts that are currently on the website, and to see examples of what post files generally look like. You can simply just duplicate the template post and start adding your own content.
