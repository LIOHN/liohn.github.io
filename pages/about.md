I'm Daniel Ene, a Computer Science graduate with a background in machine learning. Throughout my academic years and beyond I have experienced with various machine learning algorithms and statistical methods, as well as the libraries that implement them. That includes TensorFlow, Keras, scikitlearn, numpy, pandas and matplotlib. My main language is Python. I have been coding in Python for about 5 years now, ever since I taught myself the language in 2016 before starting my degree. Thanks to various academic coursework, I am also comfortable coding in Java.

I hold a Masters in Computer Science from the University of Liverpool, where I graduated in 2020. On this website you will learn more about some of my projects from academia and other places too.
